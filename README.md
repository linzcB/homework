# Python Course Homework - Lin ZC

Welcome to my repository for Python course homework. Here, you'll find projects that showcase the skills and concepts I've learned throughout the course.

## Installation

Before running the projects, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Some projects may require additional libraries, detailed in the `requirements.txt` file within their respective directories.

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/linzcB/python-course-crawler-linzc.git
cd python-course-crawler-linzc

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook named main.ipynb, which is the primary file for running the project. To execute the notebook and view the data analysis and visualizations, follow these instructions:

1.Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install notebook
```
2.Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3.Navigate to the main.ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook interface and open it.

4.Run the cells in the notebook to execute the program and generate the data and charts included in the report.
